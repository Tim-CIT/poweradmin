# Financial Support and Donations

As the sole maintainer of Poweradmin, a non-profit project, I work alongside our amazing community of voluntary
[contributors](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/graphs/contributors). I am deeply grateful for both individual
donations and financial support from organizations. While personal donations help maintain the project, companies often
provide financial support for implementing new features or fixing specific issues. This combined support enables
continuous development and improvement of the project.
